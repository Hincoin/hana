### The `datasets` branch of [Hana][]

This branch contains the benchmarks associated to the `master` branch of Hana.
These benchmarks are updated automatically by continuous integration scripts.

The benchmarks are JSON files organized in directories with the following
layout:

```
debug/
    compiler1/
        benchmark1.json
        ...
        benchmarkN.json
    ...
    compilerN/
        benchmark1.json
        ...
        benchmarkN.json
release/
    ...

default/
    ...
```

The `debug`, `release` or `default` directories represent the type of the
CMake build under which the benchmarks were generated. The `compilerN`
subdirectories correspond to the compiler used to build the benchmarks.
